A reverse search tool for OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) gathering & facial recognition via Google Custom Search & Google Vision API's.

## About

GReverse is a reverse search tool built for data researchers, penetration testers, security analysts, and more. If all your given is an image, or name and
you need more information, with GReverse you are able to perform accurate reverse image searches & data searches with a wide 
range of capabilties using OSINT (Open Source Intelligence).

## Features

- Find full matching images, partial matching images, similar matching images, and more.
- Download results to a local directory of your own choice.
- See data in multiple formats: JSON, XML, RAW(dictionary), and Pretty(Readable Output).
- Utilize the builtin functionality of Python3's multiprocessing library to download images at blazing fast speeds.
- Choose the number of processes you think your system can handle for even faster multiprocessing functionality.
- Run builtin facial recognition against your results to see, if any, are the same person with the [face_recognition](https://pypi.org/project/face-recognition/) library.
- Even restrict your own query searches to do normal Google searches when necessary, all under one hood.
